# dailyPlanner

This app is to provide a commenting space for the user to organize their activities over the hourly period in the workin day.
The goal is to allow the user to input text in their chosen hourly block
The save button should persist their entries via local storage
The moment function that is displaying the current day should be leveraged to indicate on the planner which hours are past the current time, in the current hour, and still available for future planning
